    "This is by far the most important factors in determining a rock's dielectric permittivity. Air has a relative permittvity of 1 whereas common rock forming minerals have much higher relative permittivities. This means that for dry samples, the rock's bulk dielectric permittivity decreases as the Porosity increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When rock samples are saturated with water, their dielectric permittivities can increase drastically. This is because water has a relative permittivity of 80, which is much higher than the relative permittivities of rock forming minerals. As a result, the bulf density of a rock increases as pore water saturation increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. frequency\n",
    "For hard rocks and unsaturated sedimentary samples, the dielectric permittivity can be considered constant for all intents and purposes. At sufficiently low frequencies, the same can be said about water-saturated sedimentary rocks and soils (Kaatze, 1989; Meissner and Wentz, 2004). At high frequencies however ( > 1 GHz), the electric polarization within water-saturated samples depends on the frequency of the electric field. "

    "* Locating buried objectives\n",
    "* Obtaining 3D images of the subsurface\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, assemble prior information that might be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Properties: Understanding how the target/geologic material of relevance can be characterized by its physical Properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to find a physical property of the sought object/geology that is different from that of the surroundng material. This is a crucial component that links geophysics to the geoscience problem being investigated. Important physical properties are:\n",
    "* Density\n",
    "* Compressional wave and shear wave velocities\n",
    "* Electrical conductivity (or resistivity)\n",
    "* Electrical chargeability\n",
    "* Dielectric permittivity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Surveys: Select a geophysical survey that is sensitive to the physical property of relevance to the problem.\n",
    "* Design an effective and efficient methodology for data collection. This will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Forward modelling and processing of simulated data.\n",
    "    * Addressing issues of noise and data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data: Conduct field surveys taking all necessary actions to acquire complete, high quality and cost effective data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Processing: This range from simple map makings to inversion of the data to obtain 3D images of the subsurface.\n",

    "6. Interpretation: Interpreting results in terms of the geologic or geotechnical objectives. There are two distinct components to interpretation.\n",
    "* First is estimating how physical properties are distributed.\n",
    "* Second is to gain some geological understanding based upon those physical property distributions.\n",
    "Non-uniqueness is a ubiquitous and persistent characteristic of most geophysical interpretations.\n",

    "7. Synthesis: This involve correlating the interpretations with prior and alternative information, and decide if the results are adequate for the particular problem. It means making sure geophysical result agree with everything else that is known about the problem.\n"

    "To test whether the target is adequately detectable given a certain survey layout, we use forward modelling to compute the primary field using a model that does not contain the target and the total field using a model that does contain the target.\n",

    "### Resolution\n",
    "While detectability is a key part in determining the usefulness of a given survey design, it does not guarantee that we can recover the target by inverting the total field data. By inverting for the sought-after target using synthetic modeling, we can determine if the survey has enough resolution to recover the target.\n"
