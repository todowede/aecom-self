    "GPR uses electromagnetic method for near surface investigations - typically 10s of mmeters. It exploits contrasts in electromagnetic properties __(dielectric permittivity, electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability)__ in order to define the physical boundaries of sahdow structures.\n",

    "GPR is ideal for near-suarface applications because it provides higher resolution images than methods such as FDEM, TDEM, etc. GPR cab be successfully used for:\n",
    "* Investigate concrete structures and roads.\n",
    "* Map layered structures of peat-bogs, sedimentary sequences and glacial environments.\n",
    "* Obtain the depth to groundwater or permafrost.\n",
    "* Locate buried infrastructure such as irrigation pipes, tunnels and electrical wires.\n",

    "During GPS survey, a source antenna (Tx) is used to send a pulse of radiowaves (10 Mhz to 2.6 GHz) into the ground. As the radiowaves propagates through the Earth, they are distorted as a result of the Earth's electromagnetic properties. At the boundaries where the subsurface electromagnetic properties change abruptly, radiowave signals undergo transmission, reflection and/or refraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors (Rx) measure the amplitudes and travel times of radiowaves signals that have been distorted by the Earth. Data from each trace (Tx - Rx pair) are amalgamated and represented using a radargram. The horizontal axis (distance) is used to represnet the location of the receiver relative to the source for a particular sounding.\n",

    "The vertical axis shows the travel-time of measured signal. By assuming a-priori knowledge of the radiowave velocity, the vertical axis can be represented in depth. The gray-scale denotes the amplitude of the returning signal at eact time and location."
