    "## Electrical Conductivity\n",
    "Electrical conductivity is a diagnostic physical property that quantifies how easily electrical charges move through a given material when subjected to an applied electric field. In mathematical development, it is common to use its reciprocal - electrical resistivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constitutive Relationsip\n",
    "When an electric field is applied to a material, free charges within the material experience an electrical (Coulomb) force. This force causes the free charges to move through the material along the direction of the applied field (i.e. electrical current). \n",
    "\n",
    "The ease at which electrical charges move through a material under the influence of an electric field depends on the material's electrical conductivity. \n",

    "Electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ defines the ratio betweeen the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ within a material and the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. This is known as Ohm's law and is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{J}(\\omega)= \\sigma \\mathbf{E}(\\omega)\n",

    "### Chargeability and Frequency-Dependence\n",
    "Under the influence of an electric field, free charges (such as ions) flow through materials along the direction of the applied field. For most practical case, the flow of electrical charges is in phase with the applied earth field. However when the iconic charges reach an impermeable barrier, they begin to accumulate. As a result, certain materials can act as capacitors for iconic charges; a phenomenon known as induced polarization. Iconic charge can accumulate because the pore path is blocked by metallic particles (electrode polarization) or because the pore throat is insufficiently large (membrane polarization)\n",

    "The degree of charge accumulation (capacitance) under the influence of an exterbal field is described as __chargeability__. \n",

    "Electrical Conductivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of EM surveys exploit contrasts in electrical conductivity to image the subsurface. During __direct current resisitivity__ surveys, electrical current is forced through the earth. The path taken by the current as well as the measured data, depend on the subsurafce conductivity distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many EM systems are based on the principles of EM induction. These includes FDEM, TDEM, CSEM, unexploded ordinance UXO surveys. A transmittal sends time-varying EM signals into the ground which subsequently induce electric currents. The strength of the induced currents and the secondary fields they produce are dependent on the distribution of subsurface conductivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collected during magnetotelluric (MT) and Z-axis Tipper EM (ZTEM) surveys also depend on the conductivity of the earth. These methods rely on natural sources to generate EM responses. For MT, the relationships between measured components of the electric and magnetic fields provide insight regarding the Earth's electromagnetic impendance, and indirectly its electrical conductivity."
